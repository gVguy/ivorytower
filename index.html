						Hello music maker!<br>‍<br>My name is Jon. It is my pleasure to welcome you on the website of my music studio.<br>‍<br>Once, a long long time ago, I started creating music, experimenting with ideas and audio tools. That's when I realized how exciting music production was. Yet, I still had so much to learn and my mixes rarely sounded the way I wished they did. Here, check it out:<br>
					</div>
					<div class="soundcloud-demo">
						<iframe class="musicplayer" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/803784922%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-X3QppTOCzBF&color=%2300a651&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=false&show_user=false&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false"></iframe>
						This is a part from one of the first tracks I recorded, ever. Not a masterpiece, I know. And while it has some creative idea behind it, you can easily tell that it is miles away from sounding like a professionally produced track.
					</div>
					<div>I chose the path of diving head first into the world of audio engineering. It took me many years to master my craft, but I'm so happy I did, because it gave me in-depth understanding of sound and a very special kind of hearing. Have a listen to one of my latest productions (Metal):
					</div>
					<div class="soundcloud-demo">
						<iframe id="track-above" class="musicplayer" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/803842141&color=%2300a651&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=false&show_user=false&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false"></iframe>
						Now this track has both the creativity and quality. It sounds huge and jumps out of the speakers. With the right techniques and professional approach we can bring pretty much any idea to life and give it *That&nbsp;Sound*.
					</div>
					<div class="center">
						If you want to hear more samples of my work, <a class="green-link" href="#samples">click here</a>.<br><br>
					</div>
					<div>Although this journey of audio study is inspiring in every way, I understand that not every creator wants to spend years learning the art of mixing. Most artists want to focus on bringing their musical ideas to life instead of breaking their creative process with attempts of making the song sound the way they heard it in their head (and the way it can compare to their favourite band's radio release).<br>‍<br>That's why I started this studio – I'm passionate about mixing, and I know I can help people's music sound the best it can. <br><br>If you're tired of second-guessing your decisions, or you feel that your songs sound somewhat dull and thin compared to the commercial releases, or you just want to take your mind off technical stuff, leaving it to the pros, while you get to keep those artsy juices flowing... you came to the right place :)<br><br>Hit me up and we'll create something great.<br>You inspire me!<br>–Jon<br>‍

I have more free time and, just like you, have my creativity pumped up, so feel free to shoot your latest ideas right at me! I'm working from my home studio and so should you, stay home and stay inspired!

						Mixing is a fundamental part of music production process. Groovy, punchy, crisp, dynamic, energetic, big, fat, in-your-face, jumping out of the speakers – all these qualities of a song are determined by its mix.<br><br>
						<i>What I'll need:</i> all of your song's instruments, track by track (WAV/AIFF), starting at 00:00. You should not apply any processing to the tracks. If you have a rough mix, send it over as well.<br><br>
						<i>What you'll get:</i> your music mixed with love and precision, ready to be mastered. If you aren't 100% satisfied with the result, you can let me know and we'll do the revision(s).<br><br>Turnaround: ~3 days

						Mastering is the final step of music production. In this stage, audio engineer makes sure that your music not only sounds the best it can on as many sound systems as possible, but is also ready for distribution.<br>
						If you had someone else mixing your song, or you mixed it by yourself, you can choose me to master it for you.<br><br>
						<i>What I'll need:</i> just the stereo mix (WAV/AIFF). Stem mastering is also an option.<br><br>
						<i>What you'll get:</i> your music mastered to industry standard quality with attention to detail, ready to be uploaded to the platform of your choosing.<br><br>Turnaround: 1-2 days

				You may be wondering why I don't offer mixing with mastering included. That's because I recommend you to consider hiring two different engineers for these two different jobs. Mastering isn't just about getting that commercial loudness. First of all it's a second opinion, second set of ears to critically listen for what requires final touches. However, I leave you the right to disagree and ignore my advice. If you insist, I will both mix and master your song.
